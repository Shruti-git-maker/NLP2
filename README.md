# NLP2
Overview
This notebook provides a comprehensive implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, and advanced modeling tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, Dependency Parsing, and N-gram modeling. It demonstrates how to preprocess text data, extract meaningful insights, and build predictive models using Python libraries like NLTK and SpaCy.

Features
1. Lexical Analysis
Sentence Segmentation: Breaks large text into individual sentences.

Word Tokenization: Splits sentences into words or tokens.

Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduces words to their root forms for canonicalization.

Stop Word Removal: Filters out common words with minimal semantic value.

2. Data Visualization
Visualizes token frequencies using Seaborn bar plots.

Example:

python
sns.barplot(x=token_freq.index, y=token_freq.values)
plt.title("Frequency of tokens")
3. Dependency Parsing
Explores grammatical relationships between words using SpaCy.

Displays syntactic trees to understand sentence structure.

Example:

python
spacy.displacy.render(doc, style="dep", jupyter=True)
4. POS Tagging
Tags each word in the text with its grammatical role (e.g., noun, verb).

Example:

python
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, "\t", token.pos_)
5. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Extracts named entities like names, dates, and locations from text.

Visualizes entities using SpaCy's displacy module.

Example:

python
spacy.displacy.render(doc, style="ent")
6. N-Gram Modeling
Generates sequences of adjacent symbols (bigrams, trigrams) for predicting the next word.

Builds probabilistic models to calculate word prediction probabilities.

Example:

python
def predict_next_word(model, w1, w2):
    next_word = model[(w1, w2)]
    predicted_word = max(next_word, key=next_word.get)
    print("The predicted word is", predicted_word)
Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required:

nltk: For tokenization, stopword removal, and n-gram modeling.

spacy: For dependency parsing, POS tagging, and NER.

matplotlib: For plotting visualizations.

seaborn: For advanced visualizations.

pandas: For handling tabular data.

Installation
To install the required libraries, run:

bash
pip install nltk spacy matplotlib seaborn pandas
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Usage Instructions
Clone or download the notebook file to your local machine.

Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run all cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

Key Sections
Text Preprocessing
Tokenizes text into sentences and words using NLTK.

Removes punctuation using regular expressions.

Frequency Analysis
Visualizes token frequencies before and after stopword removal.

Dependency Parsing & POS Tagging
Analyzes grammatical relationships between words and tags them with their parts of speech.

Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Extracts entities like names and locations from text.

N-Gram Modeling
Builds trigram models for predicting the next word based on word sequences.

Observations
Tokenization splits sentences into manageable units for analysis.

Stopword removal improves focus on meaningful words during frequency analysis.

Dependency parsing reveals syntactic relationships between words in a sentence.

NER identifies key entities that add semantic value to the text.

Future Improvements
Extend implementation to include deep learning-based NLP techniques like Transformers (e.g., BERT).

Add sentiment analysis and topic modeling capabilities.

Enhance visualization with interactive tools like Plotly or Dash.
